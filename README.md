# Yards - Yet Another Registering Devices Service

The goal of this project is to create a simplified, automatic method of registering devices with IPs and DNS Records for BIND9/DHCPD network setups. The servers run a daemon that will make changes as needed to data, and help report status to the API for monitoring.
